## About 
The scripts in this repo will take coordinates in POSCAR format (repeating units of a crystal lattice) and convert them to XYZ format (cartesian coordinates), which is more commonly used in input to _ab initio_ chemistry software. If you are looking for a straightforward and automated way to convert these coordinates, this repo will solve your problem.

## Getting Started
Clone this repo using the green 'Clone or download' button at the top.
Then, (from the command line)
$ listgen.csh  

 When run with no arguments, this script explains how it should be used.

Example:
$ listgen.csh POSCAR C H O   

 The output will be the following files: atomlist, direct-list, lattice-vectors

Next step: 
julia DirectToXYZ.jl
 This script will ask you for the scaling factor. It will warn you that it's expecting a Float64 as an answer. I've limited the types of the numbers used in this script to Float64. This avoids possible type instability and increases efficiency.  

 This script will then ask you for a comment, < 80 characters. This will become the comment line of the output file, which will be called coords.xyz  

 Output: coords.xyz, containing cartesian coordinates in XYZ format.  

 This script will also clean up all temporary files generated by itself and by listgen.csh before it exists.
