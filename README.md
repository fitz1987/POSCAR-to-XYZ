## Files in this repository: 
* listgen.csh : a csh script that digests a VASP POSCAR file into a format the next script will like  
*  DirectToXYZ.jl : a Julia script to convert fractional/direct coordinates to the standard chemistry XYZ format (see wikipedia on XYZ coordinates for info on this)  

## Getting Started
Clone this repo using the green 'Clone or download' button at the top.
Then, (from the command line)
$ listgen.csh  

 When run with no arguments, this script explains how it should be used.

Example:
$ listgen.csh POSCAR C H O   

 The output will be the following files: atomlist, direct-list, lattice-vectors

Next step: 
julia DirectToXYZ.jl
 This script will ask you for the scaling factor. It will warn you that it's expecting a Float64 as an answer. I've limited the types of the numbers used in this script to Float64. This avoids possible type instability and increases efficiency.  

 This script will then ask you for a comment, < 80 characters. This will become the comment line of the output file, which will be called coords.xyz  

 Output: coords.xyz, containing cartesian coordinates in XYZ format.  

 This script will also clean up all temporary files generated by itself and by listgen.csh before it exists.
